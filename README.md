Basic Chess Engine for final Project. Based upon chess framework by Eddie Sharick. An immense amount of credit is due to him for this project, as his lecture series on how to go about building an engine and creating a User Interface for chess in PyGame was critical to making our project come along so far.

We have continued to improve upon his framework with bugfixes, and a general restructuring of the chess engine as to be more in line with object oriented design principles. Additionally we have implemented a Repetoir class which enables the engine to learn openings.
